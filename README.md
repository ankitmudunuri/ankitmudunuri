### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ankit Mudunuri, and I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at Michigan State University!

My main programming languages are Python, C++, Java, and SQL (for when I work with databases), but I am looking to branch out and learn more languages in the future.

I enjoy working on AI tasks related to machine or deep learning, such as NLP and computer vision. I hope to branch out more into the cognitive side of the artificial intelligence field if I get the opportunity.

You can find me on LinkedIn with the link in my Github bio.
